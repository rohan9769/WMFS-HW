# WMFS-HW

## Overview of Solution
I have used React for the UI and Node for the backend and focused more on the functionality of the application . Since the API wasnâ€™t functional I have used static data which has around 20 items and accordingly returned the search results based on the query string that the user would input. I have used react-axios for fetching the data .  The thumbnails of the product and its name are clickable which would redirect you to the product details page where you can see the details and recommendations(similar items) for it .

## Pre-requisites
- Have the latest version of node installed [https://nodejs.org/en/download/]
- Any Code editor

## Steps to Run
- Clone the repo `git clone`
- Change directory `cd WMFS-HW`
- Change directory to client and install client dependencies :
  - `cd client` -> `npm i` or `npm install`
  - `cd ..`
- Change directory to api and install server dependencies , start the server :
  - `cd api` -> `npm i` or `npm install`
  -  start the server using `npm start`
  - server will start running on port 6500 and you would see the message `API is working!`
- Open a new terminal , change directory to client using `cd client` and load the UI using `npm start`
- The app will start running on `localhost:3000`

## Demo Link 
- Here's a short demo link of the application right from the installation part : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MH-36gvDiRq8OnMRTQrkGTE09TDiXYI6/view?usp=share_link
